If you or anyone you know has got COVID.. especially those who suffered through the symptoms.. then their natural immunity is more than adequate to protect them from severe re-infection &amp; in many cases re-infections altogether"

If one has already had covid.. you better let your natural immunity stay as it is.. don't interfere with it using the mRNA or adenovirus vaccine.. it is more harmful than beneficial"

Skeptics of natural immunity have so far been totally unable to provide enough data to prove vaccine immunity is better than natural immunity at preventing severe covid.

So.. please do give some data"
