That doesn't mean they don't serve ppl but to curtail spread. To limit the OPD and IPD services they had to close for public. Similar happened in Fed Hospitals.

From what I remember of my calls in COVID days, people were so understandably sacred of the disease that if they were educated enough to get tested, they'd rush to the hosp. It took us quite long to realise not everyone needs admsn"
1453358816205189120,,Wed Oct 27 13:51:58 +0000 2021,@TahreemKhanP @MonazzaAlawi How long can you keep a patient in the ER? Not to forget that the specified bays for COVID had very limited beds. Don't be irrational.
1453357616751591433,,Wed Oct 27 13:47:12 +0000 2021,"@TahreemKhanP @MonazzaAlawi Well, COVID isn't not some disease that you can treat in ER. If severe it requires admission and ITC care. Mil hosps weren't admitting non uniform people because they have a huge dependant population. Given that pandemic didn't, by any means, lessen the burden of other diseases."

Everyone went through the same. 
Military hospitals were closed for civilians due to expected rise in covid patients by NCOC. 
They intended making all mil hospitals to act as Covid hospital if things go South. 
Everyone was allowed after restrictions were lifted"

The impact that this pandemic has had on general public transcend all calamities. Losing a loved one because there's no hospital bed and no institution to back you up.

Do you know how much this pandemic has effected the ""ordinary"" civilians? How many people lost their jobs? It is far far complex."
